# Comp_Socket_Server



General Plan : 

We have to create more complex msg handler we ever build 
Because we have ( or will ) different type of the client. 

We can create two different different class of the client,
Upper Client -> Which is comment supper class for the lower class. Handle the 
first init msg in order to create correct lower class which they have own msg hand and etc.
